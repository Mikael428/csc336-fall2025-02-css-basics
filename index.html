    <h1 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">LIL DARKIE</h1>
    <p style="background-color:lightblue;">This song was created by rapper Lil Darkie (styled as<i> LIL DARKIE</i>) and is a pretty good song about not selling out. It was released in late 2023, around the time I started listening to him in general. I started looking at different kinds of artists because of him as well.</p>

    <h1 style="background-color: antiquewhite; color:black;text-align:center">Sonic The Hedgehog</h1>
    <p id="para1";style="background-color:lightblue;"><i>Sonic Generations</i> is a great game that celebrates the history of the <i> Sonic the Hedgehog</i> franchise. Half of the levels within the game are <span style="color:red">"2-D"</span> levels based on more classic games, and the other half are <span style="color:darkblue">"3-D"</span> levels based on more modern levels. It is pretty enjoyable to play, and has a lot references to the franchise as a whole including the songs that you can listen to in the record room and (only in the original version) you can play the original <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> game. </p>

    <h2 style="background-color: aliceblue; color:black; text-align:center;">Release Date</h2>
    <p style="background-color:lightblue;"><span style="color:black"> The game was released in November 2011 worldwide. A couple of months after the 20th anniversary of the franchise, but was still able to come out the same year and be a good game. If you wanna see an image that is associated with the game, check it out <a href="time.html">here: </a></span></p>

    <h1 style="background-color: aliceblue; color:red; text-align:center;">Shadow Generations</h1>
    <p style="background-color: brown;"><span style="color:white">Earlier, I mentioned an "original" version of Sonic Generations. Well, recently there was a re-release of the game that included graphics that were improved a little (not by much but still looks better than the original) and more importantly, a new Shadow game along with it. This is the first game Shadow has been playable in since <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> (2006), which is not a game that needs to be explained. Shadow Generations, as it is called, continues the storyline from <i>Shadow the Hedegehog</i> and is pretty fun to play.</p>
